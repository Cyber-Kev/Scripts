# Scripts
Linux &amp; Ansible Scripts/cybersecurity class

Welcome all: 

This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my time at Columbia Engineering.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
